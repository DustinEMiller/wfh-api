# Wfh node backend
A node implementation of the wfh api, more details see blogpost: http://pebblecode.com/blog/hack-day-wfh-bot/

in slack you can do:
`/wfo`
`/wfh`

you will need to configure Slack slash [commands](https://slack.com/services#service_16).
use `/wfh` and `/wfo` to point to: `/webhooks/slack`, use a post request and add the tokens to the apps environment variables

### parameters
message: `/wfh message:I'll be at home in my pants` or `/wfo message:I'll be at the stand up desk today`
default: `/wfh default:wfo` this allows your default location to be either `wfh,wfo` 

#Development && installation
[Install CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/#download) and run.
For a nicer couch db ui install: `npm i -g fauxton` then in a new shell run `fauxton`

`npm i && npm i -g nodemon`
start server locally
`npm run dev`

When NODE_ENV === 'development' connection will be made with localhost couchdb. 

###Configuration for local development.
Copy `config.template.js > config.js` and complete the default fields `getEnv('ENV_VAR','DEFAULT_VALUE')`,
